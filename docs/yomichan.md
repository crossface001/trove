# Yomichan Setup Tutorial

## What is Yomichan?
Yomichan is a browser extension that allows you to look up Japanese words with both the meaning and the reading on web pages with ease.  

## Getting Started 
Yomichan is available for both Chromium and Firefox based browsers. You can find the respective versions below.  
[Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/yomichan/ogmnaimimemjmbakcfefmnahgdfhfami)  
[Firefox Add-Ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/yomichan/)  
Once installed, it will open a new tab page, just close it for now so we don't confuse each other.  

## Acquiring Dictionaries
When you first install Yomichan, you need to load dictionaries into it in order to use it.  
These files use the `.zip` extension and **are not to be extracted by the user.**

You can find my collection of Yomichan dictionaries below. This will have everything you need and (probably) don't need. :slight_smile:  
→→→→[Shoui's Yomichan Dictionary Collection](https://learnjapanese.link/dictionaries)←←←←　　    

I recommend you install the following dictionaries:  
	- `Bilingual/[Bilingual] JMdict (English).zip`  
	- `Bilingual/[Bilingual] 新和英.zip`  
	- `Kanji/[Kanji] KANJIDIC (English).zip`  
	- `Grammar/Dictionary of Japanese Grammar.zip` **(NEW!)**  

## Installing Dictionaries and basic usage
  
1. Click on the ![yomichan-icon](img/yomichan-icon.png) icon in the browser toolbar.  
2. Click on the ![cog](img/yomichan-cog.png) icon to access the settings page.  
3. On the left sidebar, click on "Dictionaries" and then click on "Configure installed and enabled dictionaries…"  
4. Click the "Import" button on the bottom.  
5. Here's where you select the dictionaries to import. Please only import the following. 
	- `[Bilingual] JMdict (English).zip`
	- `[Bilingual] 新和英.zip`
	- `[Kanji] KANJIDIC (English).zip`
	- `Grammar/Dictionary of Japanese Grammar.zip` **(NEW!)**  

6. Please wait for the dictionaries to import. This could take a while.
7. Once complete, you can test Yomichan by holding down the ++shift++ key and hovering over Japanese text. Here is a sample: 日本語. It will display a pop up box displaying the definitions separated by dictionary.  

![Yomichan Demo](img/yomidemo1.png) 

Click anywhere outside of the box or press the ++esc++ key to dismiss.
 Click on an individual kanji in the headword to view kanji information (only functional with KANJIDIC installed).

8. You can click the ![audio](img/yomichan-audio.png) button to hear the word being pronounced by a native speaker.

In your browser extensions toolbar, if you click on the Yomichan logo, then on the ![search icon](img/yomichan-search.png) icon or the ++alt+insert++ keyboard shortcut to access Yomichan Search, this is where you can use Yomichan as a standalone Japanese to English dictionary. 

Pop up box size can be edited with advanced settings enabled.  
A full dark mode can be enabled in the settings too.  

**JMdict** is the dictionary hosted on Jisho.org. Jisho.org is not its own dictionary, rather it's a portal that accesses JMdict. This is the most common Japanese to English dictionary.  

**新和英** (Shinwaei) is a Japanese-English dictionary intended for Japanese people. It has many example sentences which can prove to be very useful for Japanese learners. A variation of this with even more example sentences is called `[Bilingual] 研究社　新和英大辞典　第５版.zip` can also be found in my dictionaries collection.  

**KANJIDIC** is a kanji dictionary, it allows you to view information of individual kanji.  

**Dictionary of Japanese Grammar**, or 日本語文法辞典(全集), is a dictionary that helps you look up grammar (duh!).  


## Allowing access to file URLs

Enabling this allows you to use Yomichan on local files such as .HTML files.  

!!! failure "PDF Files"
    On Chrome, it is impossible to use Yomichan on PDF files.  

Chromium:  
	- Right click the ![yomi icon](img/yomichan-icon.png)  
	- Click "Manage Extensions"  
	- Enable "Allow access to file URLs"  

Firefox:  
	- Enabled by default.  

## Bonus: Adding Forvo extra audio source  

You may encounter missing audio with the default Yomichan audio sources, adding [Forvo](https://ja.forvo.com/) will help fill in the gaps.  

Thanks to [jamesnicholas](https://github.com/jamesnicolas/yomichan-forvo-server) for this wonderful add-on!

This requires you to have Anki (2.1 and newer) installed and open on your computer to work.  

1. Copy this code `580654285`
2. In Anki, in the menu at the top, click on **Tools**, then **Add-ons**.
3. In the new window, click **Get Add-ons...** and paste the code `580654285` into the text box and click **OK**
4. Restart Anki by closing it and opening it back up again.
5. In the Yomichan settings page ![cog](img/yomichan-cog.png), click **Audio** on the left, and then click on **Configure audio playback sources...**
6. Click **Add** and then select **Custom** from the drop down menu. 
7. Now where it says **Custom audio source (?)**, select the type **JSON** from the drop down menu.
8. In the URL text box, enter this `http://localhost:8770/?expression={expression}&reading={reading}`

## Bonus: Android use with Kiwi Browser  

Kiwi Browser is a Chromium browser that supports extensions, including Yomichan. You can download it below.  
[Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kiwibrowser.browser)  
 
You can access the Yomichan settings page by going in :material-dots-vertical: > Yomichan	![yomi icon](img/yomichan-icon.png) > Settings.  

Please see above for link to download the extension, link to the dictionaries collection and recommended starter dictionaries.  
Importing a dictionary is a very processor intensive process and will take a long time depending on your phone. Please be patient.  

Tap on a word to look it up. In the case that it is not working, you may need to turn off the modifier key.

## Anki Setup

See [AnimeCards Site](https://animecards.site/)

## Offline audio server

This is entirely optional but people who may be limited by internet access may want to consider this as it allows Yomichan's audio functionality to work offline.  


**Yomichan Local Audio Server Addon version 7**

Credits to Zetta (original author) 神出鬼没 (added support for NHK 2016)

**How to Install:**

**CAUTION:** Backup your audio files if they're **not** in `user_files`. See next message for **CHANGES**.


1. Download [localaudio_v07.ankiaddon](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/778430038159655012/945816526047572039/localaudio_v07.ankiaddon)  

2. Double click it and install  

3. Download jpod101 audio files (The other jpod101 dump has some missing audio files, should use this one): [HERE](https://mega.nz/file/8yxgSC7Y#P20vHhgWz_1XoOAhNQfriZJzJmN7WfwpoyZL6WS00MI) and extract it to `addons21\955441350\user_files` and replace the `jpod_files` with the extracted folder  

4. Download jpod101 alternate audio files (I tried to scrape everything I can, but I kept getting IP banned every time, so there may be some missing audio files, still have +100k audio files though, should be 99% of them): [HERE](https://mega.nz/file/snxG1Aqa#a0xRK4uMRq1ZOCXl-8ahpHjnswwsUdXlL7DG6Anillo) and extract it to `addons21\955441350\user_files` and replace the `jpod_alternate_files` with the extracted folder  

5. Download NHK 2016 audio files: [HERE](https://mega.nz/file/6gJUFYrR#NZ61jkCb8zWZEbZe0m_OSAv2Kqxqae5zZGKm8uFIXfo) (Thanks kezi ) and extract it to `addons21\955441350\user_files` and replace the `nhk16_files` with the extracted folder  

6. In Yomichan Settings, click `Configure audio playback sources`, Add `Custom URL (JSON)` and URL: `http://localhost:5050/?sources=jpod,jpod_alternate,nhk16&term={term}&reading={reading}` You can reorder `sources` to be `sources=nhk16,jpod,jpod_alternate` if you want` nhk16` to be the first one  

`user_files` folder structure

```
.
├── jpod_alternate_files
│   └── よむ - 読む.mp3
│   └── ...
├── jpod_files
│   └── よむ - 読む.mp3
│   └── ...
└── nhk16_files
    ├── audio
    │   └── 20170616125910.aac
    │   └── ...
    └── entries.json
```

Once installed, scan a word like 読む and play audio. It will be slow for the first time because it needs to build the map and cache it as a file. (編集済)
